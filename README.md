# Design-of-a-turbulence-generator-for-limnological-studies
Design and validation of a small-scale turbulence generator for limnological flume studies (final-year research project).

Objectives 
[1] Review state of the art small scale turbulence generators that can be used in a flume;  
[2] Design à suitable turbulence generator;  
[3] Fabricate a prototype;  
[4] Validate the prototype by deploying it in a flume.
